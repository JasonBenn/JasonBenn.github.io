<div>Ugh. I had a short burst of productivity yesterday morning and then I was unproductive for the rest of the day. Days like this aren't just unproductive, they're also demoralizing and frustrating and can lead to more bad days. I live in a world that is both full of distractions and in which it is incredibly easy to indulge in those distractions. Here are the worst offenders:</div>

<ol>
    <li>Phone: when I pick up my phone and see notifications, especially banners, I feel an urge to clear them.</li>
    <li>Internet: it's far too easy to open Chrome and go to my favorite websites - I can go from a moment of weakness to my favorite website in a sequence of 7 easy hotkeys. Some of these websites even feel productive (sort of), like news sites or programming blogs.</li>
    <li>Messaging: Messenger and especially Slack are a constant source of distraction, for the same reason as my phone - when I see a red bubble, I feel an urge to clear it. Slack is especially bad because I'm a member of 4 very active workspaces, and even though I turn off notifications, there is actually _no way_ to turn off the red dot on Slack when _any_ of these workspaces has a new message, and I can see that red dot _every time_ I alt-tab, which I do constantly.</li>
    <li>Procrastination: I suspect my brain is spoiled for novelty at the moment. Sometimes, when I'm stuck on a difficult task, I feel something like a mental force field around the thing - in these moments, I go to the Internet, or work through my endless list of notifications, or do things that aren't important. The more I indulge distractions, the shorter my attention span gets - if I get stuck on a bug and go for longer than a few minutes without some stimulation, for example, I can feel the urge rising. This is not an issue when I'm happy, or in a state of flow, or making steady progress; it's particularly bad when I'm sick, or tired, or working on something I'm less enthusiastic about, or when I get stuck frequently, or when I'm doing something hard. I want a way to break the circuit when I get trapped in this pattern and to restore my discipline.</li>
</ol>

<div>Here are some things I'm going to try, starting now:</div>

<ol>
    <li>Phone: Set my phone to black & white. Moved all apps that give me notifications from other people to my second home screen. Prevented any app from making banners, only badges - none of which I can see when I open my phone. I'll go through all of these apps once or twice a day, and all at once.</li>
    <li>Internet: I bought Cold Turkey Blocker and set a schedule for the eleven 5-hour deep work windows I want every week, so that every website I find distracting is blocked 8am-1pm M-Sat and 2pm-7pm M-F. I've tried this before during Cold Turkey's free trial, but it didn't work - I had nothing to replace the procrastination urge with. (Things I've already done that have been incredibly helpful: buying an actual alarm clock and leaving my computer and phone upstairs at night.)</li>
    <li>Messaging: Removed all workspaces except Sourceress' from my desktop Slack app and moved them to a Chrome bookmarks folder which I'll open once or twice a day; this way, I can finally get rid of the red bubbles from Slack from every workspace other than the ones from my work. I'm excited about this one. I also removed the Messenger app from my Mac. (Things I've already done that have been moderately helpful: muting all Slack channels except for the two that I actually need to stay on top of).</li>
    <li>Procrastination: Found a good free meditation app, created 2.5 and 7.5 minute meditation presets that I like, and am keeping my phone and a separate pair of bluetooth headphone by my desk (so I don't have to fiddle with the Bluetooth settings on the pair that's connected to my laptop). When I feel the urge to procrastinate, I'll meditate instead. I'm hopeful that over time this will rewire my brain and improve my ability to power through challenges more consistently. Also, it should help that there are fewer outlets for distraction.</li>
</ol>

<div>Would appreciate commiserations and/or suggestions if you have them, anonymous reader. Everyone deals with this to some degree, I suspect that most of us want to get better, but very few people talk about it.</div>
