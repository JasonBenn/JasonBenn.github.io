<p>I've been asked about my coding journey often enough that I created this website! Please let me know if you have any questions, I'll add them here for the benefit of everyone who reads this in the future.</p>

<h2>roadmap</h2>

<p>I learned how to code after college via <a href="#books">reading books</a> and going to Dev Bootcamp from Feb 2013 - Oct 2013, I learned CS using
    <a href="http://teachyourselfcs.com">teachyourselfcs.com</a> content between Fall 2014 and Spring 2017 (mostly by going to their in-person classes at the Bradfield School of Computer Science), and have been learning Machine Learning from
    <a href="course.fast.ai">course.fast.ai</a> and an academic paper reading club since March 2017. It's fun and it's worth it! I love and strongly recommend this job, and feel great about my future.</p>

<p>The gold standard pathway to becoming a great engineer, IMO, would be Hack Reactor and/or Lambda Academy -> become a web developer for a year -> go to the Bradfield School of Computer Science to work through the <a href="http://teachyourselfcs.com">teachyourselfcs.com</a> content -> get a second job as a full-stack engineer -> after another couple years of experience you'll be able to get a job anywhere.</p>

<h5>non-bootcamp options</h5>

<i>@jason if i may ask, what do u think about places like lambda school, free code camp, and UC Berkeley Extension school? i'm basically trying to find a comparable hack reactor alternative here</i>

<p>
    <div>Free Code Camp: I'm suspicious - I'm a firm believer in working with people, in person and full-time, as you learn to do this stuff. It's too difficult to set your own curriculum and do it alone - you're always second-guessing if you're spending your time wisely or not, and that anxiety takes a ton of energy in my experience. Having peers to help unstick you and a teacher to help guide you will increase your velocity. Also, this curriculum seems to take the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach.</div>
    <div>Berkeley Extension School: Not a big fan of Berkeley's offering to be honest. Too scattered - you want a sequence that was planned start-to-finish so it's coherent. Bootcamps are great for this.</div>
    <div>Lambda School: good in theory. Great incentive alignment/pricing structure, the right length, and good that they go over some CS too. Very new and unproven. Lambda School content looks pretty good. I wish it wasn't online - if you can find a group to work through material with, then I'd recommend this one.</div>
</p>

<h5>if you can't do full-time</h5>

<p>
<i>
@jason i know u mentioned u think it's best to do this full time (totally agree with u there), but would u happen to have any tips for people who also work full time and can't study full time right now? what can we do to make the most of our part time learning to code
</i>
</p>

<p>
(From another person in a thread): ^ lambda school lol. when i'm not doing sourceress stuff, i'm constantly working on problems, reading, etc. I actually like the part time.
</p>

<p>
(me): I spent like $15k on living expenses and rent when I was learning full-time - saved some and put the rest on credit cards with 0% APR for the first year of card membership, then paid them off before the 12 months were up. I moved to Chicago for the 3 month bootcamp and then moved to SF afterwards and found a job 2 months later. They were cash-back, too, so I actually made ~$400 off of my free loan :grin:
</p>

<h5>getting your first job</h5>

<p>As far as timeline: the first step to becoming a great SWE is to become a productive web developer and get a job - focus on practical skills, like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, basic proficiency with a backend web framework (lots of choices), and enough algorithms/data structures knowledge to be able to complete the 50 leetcode problems. This will take 6 months full-time to learn and 3-6 months to interview and find a job (this is the hard part but you can do it). The year after that you should adjust to your job. The year after that you should learn computer science with Bradfield.  Then you're set fo lyfe.</p>

<p>Or at least, this was the path I did. Looks like Lambda School mixes CS and web development skills into one big program - that would work too.</p>

<p>Also, it'll be tough, but you really should ignore the hype about AI and blockchain, for now, and just focus on building your foundational CS skills. CS is fun too and will serve you throughout your entire career; AI/blockchain will be so different in just a couple years that you'll want to wait to learn them until right before you get a job in them.</p>

<h5>bias against bootcampers</h5>
<p>
<i>
@jason have you noticed a bias against people who are self taught or who completed a coding bootcamp? is there an obvious preference given to candidates who have a degree in computer science or software engineering, especially in SF?
</i>
</p>
<p>
Yep. Bootcamps teach you how to do web development, but it'll be using batteries-included frameworks. Developing further as a programmer requires computer science, which is the study of what computers are capable of, and until Bradfield and Lambda School came along nobody was even trying to teach these skills to bootcamp grads, so it was reasonable to assume that such hires would plateau after their first couple years. But I think the landscape is changing and it'll be increasingly normal to interleave learning and professional experience like this. Knowing this can give you a leg up but it'll still be pretty hard to get your first job, just keep at it and study the right things.

<h5 id="books">preparing for a bootcamp</h5>
<p>
  <i>[I read about you in “Deep Work”.] I’m interested in replicating your path. How did you decide which books to study during your “deep work” phase? Would you be willing to share a recommended list?</i>
</p>
<p>
<div>I studied for two months full-time before going to Dev Bootcamp (my original plan was to live in my parents' basement and study until I got a job) and if it's possible I would recommend you try to do the same. The curriculum I followed was kind of a hodgepodge of books - I ended up memorizing Ruby and not realizing until much later that I needed to learn JavaScript, for example. Here's the approximate sequence I wish I had done instead, with the % of the time I would recommend spending on each step:</div>
<br>
<div>20% A BACKEND LANGUAGE (should be whatever language your bootcamp teaches - could be Python, Ruby, JS/node.js, etc)</div>
<div>- <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a></div>
<div>- <a href="https://effectivepython.com/">Bonus: Effective Python</a></div>
<div>- Project idea: Battleship in the terminal</div>
<br>
<div>5% RELATIONAL DATABASES</div>
<div>- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197">Intro to Relational Databases</a></div>
<div>- Project: install PostgreSQL, design a relational schema, implement/seed it with raw SQL</div>
<br>
<div>5% STATIC SITES</div>
<div>- <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Learn to Code HTML &amp CSS</a></div>
<div>- <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/">Bonus: Learn to Code Advanced HTML &amp CSS</a></div>
<div>- Project idea: implement one or two of your favorite effects from https://tympanus.net/codrops</div>
<br>
<div>25% SERVER-SIDE RENDERING WEBAPPS</div>
<div>- the Django equivalent of the Rails Tutorial, although ideally it would be for something simpler than Django, like Flask. Don't know of a good resource.</div>
<div>- Project idea: Reddit</div>
<br>
<div>20% JAVASCRIPT</div>
<div>- <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a></div>
<div>- Project idea: Snake in the browser in a &gtcanvas&lt</div>
<br>
<div>25% CLIENT-SIDE RENDERING WEBAPPS</div>
<div>- React: but... ugh, every tutorial also includes Webpack, ES6, Redux, etc, etc, etc. By the time you get to this point, anything I recommend would be out of date, so just email me at jasoncbenn@gmail.com.</div>
<br>
<div>What I actually did was spend two months full-time reading Ruby books and memorizing the entire language and parts of the standard library with Anki flashcards, which made me absolutely <em>demolish</em> the Ruby section of my bootcamp, but didn't help at all for the last 9 out of 12 weeks. Would not recommend. In two months I could've covered all of the above material.</div>
