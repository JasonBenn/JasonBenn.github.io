            <h3>A little about me...</h3>
            <h4>I am a web developer</h4>
            <p>From front to back.  I am as enthusiastic while designing a pixel-perfect landing page with CSS as I am while optimizing the performance of a fuzzy search algorithm.  I am always coding!</p>

            <h4>I am always seeking learning opportunities</h4>
            <p>My top priority is to always be improving my skill and knowledge as a developer.  I look for learning opportunities in every task and interaction, no matter how big or small.</p>

            <h4>I've been busy</h4>
            <p>I recently attended <a class='links' target='_blank' href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>, and spent about 1,000 hours coding in just 12 weeks.  I have never had a more intense or effective learning experience in my entire life.  I turned down a job at Fortune's #5 Best Company to Work For to do it.  It was the best decision I've ever made.</p>

          <div class="column">
            <h3>...and a little about you.</h3>
            <h4>You need a quick learner and a hard worker</h4>
            <p>I'm systematic and diligent in my self-education.  I devour textbooks whole.  In the last four months, I've read around 3,000 pages of technical literature.</p>

            <h4>You need a team player</h4>
            <p>Dev Bootcamp emphasizes developer soft skills.  In addition to practicing empathy, kindness, and giving and receiving feedback, we also spent most of our time in pairs.  <a class='links recommendations'>Here is some anonymous feedback I received after learning how to be a better teammate</a>.</p>

            <h4>You want someone with passion!</h4>
            <p>I really love this stuff!  I have a deep desire to become a great engineer.</p>

      <li>"It was great pairing with you. You have a natural ability to explain things very well."</li>
      <li>"You are very smart. Seriously. It's impressive."</li>
      <li>"As we talked about after our pair session, you were the best pair partner I've had so far. I really appreciated your patience and you allowing me to drive most of the time."</li>
      <li>"Your mind wraps around the code in ways that amaze me. I'd be overjoyed to work with you anytime."</li>
      <li>"Probably the best pair I have had so far. You have tons of technical knowledge but also hear out your (mostly) not as advanced pair. You make other people feel like you are learning from them as well."</li>
