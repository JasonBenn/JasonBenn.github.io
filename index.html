            <h3>A little about me...</h3>
            <h4>I am a web developer</h4>
            <p>From front to back.  I am as enthusiastic while designing a pixel-perfect landing page with CSS as I am while optimizing the performance of a fuzzy search engine.  I am always coding.</p>

            <h4>I am always seeking learning opportunities</h4>
            <p>My top priority is to always be improving my skill and knowledge as a developer.  I look for learning opportunities in every task and interaction, no matter how big or small.</p>

            <h4>I've been busy</h4>
            <p>I just finished <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>.  I coded for 1,000 hours in 12 weeks.  I have never had a more intense or effective learning experience in my entire life.  I turned down a job at Fortune's #5 Best Company to Work For to do it.  It was the best decision I've ever made.</p>

          <div class="column">
            <h3>...and a little about you.</h3>
            <h4>You need someone who will teach himself</h4>
            <p>I'm systematic and diligent in my self-education.  I devour textbooks whole.  In the last four months, I've read around 3,000 pages of technical literature.</p>

            <h4>You need a team player</h4>
            <p>Dev Bootcamp emphasizes developer soft skills.  In addition to practicing empathy, kindness, and giving and receiving feedback, we also spent most of our time in pairs.  <a class='recommendations'>Here is some anonymous feedback I received for my work as a teammate</a>.</p>

      <li>"Your technical chops are superb and you match that with drive and patience for your less-experienced peers (myself among them). I really like how you work efficiently yet there's no sense of rushing."</li>
      <li>"It was great pairing with you. You have a natural ability to explain things very well."</li>
      <li>"You are very smart. Seriously. It's impressive."</li>
      <li>"As we talked about after our pair session, you were the best pair partner I've had so far. I really appreciated your patience and you allowing me to drive most of the time."</li>
      <li>"Your mind wraps around the code in ways that amaze me. I'd be overjoyed to work with you anytime."</li>
      <li>"Probably the best pair I have had so far. You have tons of technical knowledge but also hear out your (mostly) not as advanced pair. You make other people feel like you are learning from them as well."</li>
