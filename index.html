    <p>"...the dream Dev Bootcamp student. An incredibly hard worker, very driven, super talented and motivated"</p>
    <p>-Dave Hoover, founder of Dev Bootcamp Chicago</p>
    <hr>
    <p>At Dev Bootcamp, there was a major emphasis on developer soft skills, including pairing. To this end we provided daily and anonymous constructive feedback to each other. Here is some of that feedback:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Working with you was great! We had a ton of fun completing the day's challenges."</li>
      <li>"Your technical chops are superb and you match that with drive and patience for your less-experienced peers (myself among them). I really like how you work efficiently yet there's no sense of rushing."</li>
      <li>"It was great pairing with you. You have a natural ability to explain things very well."</li>
      <li>"You are very smart. Seriously. It's impressive."</li>
      <li>"As we talked about after our pair session, you were the best pair partner I've had so far. I really appreciated your patience and you allowing me to drive most of the time."</li>
      <li>"Your mind wraps around the code in ways that amaze me. I'd be overjoyed to work with you anytime."</li>
      <li>"Probably the best pair I have had so far. You have tons of technical knowledge but also hear out your (mostly) not as advanced pair. You make other people feel like you are learning from them as well."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>"Jason was ridiculously patient with me and took the     time to explain errors in depth. The thing I like most is that he takes the time to really research things and understand why they are happening rather than just trying to get the answer and move on."</p>
